Both DNA and RNA are extracted from the tumor tissue and sent to the NCI Molecular Characterization Laboratory to run a tumor biomarker test; the test results are sent to the participant and their provider through their secure accounts on the Participant and Provider Engagement Website. Study and research updates are also posted on the Participant and Provider Engagement Website.</p><p>Tissue may also be sent to the NCI Patient-Derived Models Repository to develop cancer models for research. Biomarker and health data are stripped of personal identifying information, stored securely within NCI data repositories, and made available to qualified cancer researchers. Program staff use the Web Reporting System to monitor and review study data to ensure compliance with the protocol and regulatory requirements.</p>",
