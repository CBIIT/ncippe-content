To understand why these happen, researchers need to look at cancer tissue donated by patients over the course of their treatment.</p><p>These kinds of samples have been hard to get&mdash;but the Cancer Moonshot<sup>SM</sup>  Biobank wants to change that. By donating your samples to the Biobank over the course of your care, for up to 5 years, researchers can study how cancers change over time, and how to fight later-stage cancers.</p>",
