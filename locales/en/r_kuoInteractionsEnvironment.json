We can study the biology of a specific cancer and find new treatments for people by using the 3-D copy of a person’s tumor. ",

			"body": "We will study the cancer organoids to understand how tumors grow, change,and respond to-or resist-drug treatments.We will study how cancer cells interact with their surrounding environment, such as immune cells. And, we hope to learn more about how cancer immunotherapy may work for people with cancer.",
