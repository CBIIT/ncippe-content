				"body": "<p>When you browse through any website, including the Biobank website, certain information about your visit can be collected. The Biobank uses the Adobe Omniture Web Analytics, and Crazy Egg programs to collect information automatically and continuously. We use this information to measure the number of visitors to our site and its various sections, distinguish between new and returning visitors to help make our site useful to visitors, and to better understand how various parts of the website are accessed and used. The reports generated by these programs are composed of aggregated data and do not contain information about individual people. Reports are available to the Biobank website managers, members of their communications and web teams, and other designated staff who require this information to perform their duties. They may also be made available to researchers working with the Biobank who want to study how various parts of the website are accessed and used. Some aggregated, anonymous (unable to be tracked to an individual) data may be published in scientific journals by these researchers to help others understand how resources like the Biobank website are accessed and used.</p><p>The Biobank website uses Qualtrics, a cloud-based online survey tool to create and deploy online surveys that collect feedback, information, opinions and data from a random sample of visitors to the public portion of its website in order to gauge visitor experiences. These surveys do not collect personally identifiable information (PII) from the general public. Although the survey invitation is presented to a random sample of visitors, it is optional. If you decline the survey, you will still have access to the identical information and resources on the Biobank site as those who take the survey. The survey reports are exclusively available to Biobank managers, members of the Biobank communications and web teams, the survey research team, and other designated staff who require this information to perform their duties. Aggregated, anonymous data (i.e. masked information so it cannot be identified with you) and survey results will be published in publicly-accessible scientific journals. More information about Qualtrics can be found at <a href='https://www.qualtrics.com/core-xm/' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank' class='external' aria-describedby='external'>https://www.qualtrics.com/core-xm/</a>.</p><p>The Biobank retains the data from Adobe Analytics, and Qualtrics as long as needed to support the mission of the Biobank.</p><h4>Internet Protocol (IP) addresses collection</h4><p>The Biobank website collects your full Internet Protocol (IP) address, browser type, and location information for internal governmental purposes related to information and system security. The full IP address allows your computer or other device to communicate with the Biobank website on the internet. Without the exchange of IP addresses between visitors and websites, communication over the internet would not be possible. We therefore collect IP addresses when you connect to the Biobank website so we can communicate with your computer and exchange information.</p><p>For further information about the National Cancer Institute privacy policy, visit <a href='https://www.cancer.gov/policies/privacy-security' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'>https://www.cancer.gov/policies/privacy-security</a></p>",

These include applications hosted on other non-government websites and those embedded on the Biobank webpage.</p><p>The Biobank website provides links to certain external websites that are not subject to the same laws, regulations, or privacy policies as federal websites. The Biobank website is part of Cancer.gov. If you click to an external website from a Cancer.gov website, you generally will receive notice that you are leaving the Cancer.gov site.

Once you leave Cancer.gov and access an external website, you should review the external privacy and security policies because the Biobank website policy does not apply to your interactions with that site.</p><h4>Endorsements</h4><p>The Biobank website does not endorse any commercial product, service, process, or enterprise. Links to other web sites and references to any commercial product or enterprise are provided solely for the convenience of the user and do not constitute an endorsement or recommendation of any kind.

Use of some of these applications could cause personally identifiable information to become available or accessible to the Biobank, regardless of whether the Biobank solicits or collects it. The table below lists some of third-party social media websites and applications we use</p><h4>Types of third-party websites and applications</h4><h5>Facebook</h5><p>NCI has two main Facebook pages — <a href='https://www.facebook.com/nih.gov' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank' class='external' aria-describedby='external'>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</a>, and <a href='https://www.facebook.com/NCIatFrederick/' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank' class='external' aria-describedby='external'>National Cancer Institute at Frederick</a>. NCI Facebook pages are managed by NCI staff members who post news and other items of interest to be consumed by the public. If you have a Facebook account, you can log in to your account to post comments, and &#39;like&#39; NCI Facebook pages and individual entries. If once you click on an NCI Facebook page, you comment or click on the &#39;like&#39; button, some of your personal information will be visible to NCI staff and other Facebook site visitors. The amount of visible personal information displayed will depend on your own Facebook privacy settings. You can completely avoid displaying any personal information by not creating a Facebook account, not posting comments, not clicking on the &#39;like&#39; options, or not interacting with NCI Facebook accounts in any way (i.e. private messaging, sharing NCI posts, etc.). NCI staff do not collect, use or disclose any information about visitors who comment or &#39;like&#39; the NCI Facebook sites. However, as a practice, comment moderator policy requires the removal from NCI Facebook pages of any comments that contain spam or are improper, inflammatory, off-topic or offensive. Repeat offenders may be subject to banning. The information is then saved on a password-protected shared drive accessible to NCI managers, system owners, communications staff, web teams, and other designated staff who require this information to perform their duties. The Facebook Privacy Policy is available at <a href='https://www.facebook.com/policy.php' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank' class='external' aria-describedby='external'>https://www.facebook.com/policy.php</a></p><h5>Twitter</h5><p>NCI uses Twitter to send short messages (up to 280 characters) or &quot;Tweets&quot; to share information about NCI with our audiences and respond to comments and inquiries sent via Twitter to NCI. While users may read the NCI Twitter feeds without subscribing to them, users who want to subscribe to (or follow) NCI Twitter feeds must create a Twitter account at <a href='http://www.twitter.com' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank' class='external' aria-describedby='external'>www.twitter.com</a>.</p><p>To create an account, you must provide some personal information, such as name, user name, password, and email address. You have the option to provide additional personal information including a short biography, location, or a picture. Most information you provide for a Twitter account is available to the public, but you can modify how much of your information is visible by changing your privacy settings at the Twitter.com website.</p><p>NCI staff members monitor the number of subscribers and respond to comments and queries via Twitter, however our staff does not use the personal information of their Twitter followers. NCI does not collect, maintain, disclose, or share any information about people who follow NCI on Twitter. (See <a href='http://twitter.com/privacy' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank' class='external' aria-describedby='external'>Twitter Privacy Policy</a>).</p><h5>YouTube</h5><p>NCI videos introduce you to many different aspects of the research that NCI supports and connect you to our research-based information resources. Some videos feature stories from researchers, cancer patients, and their caregivers. Others seek to explain NCI&#39;s major research programs. Most of these videos are available on NCI&#39;s websites as well. (See <a href='http://www.youtube.com/t/privacy_at_youtube' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank' class='external' aria-describedby='external'>YouTube.com Privacy Policy</a>).</p><p>To be notified when NCI adds new videos, users with YouTube accounts can subscribe to the NCI gov channel. NCI staff members monitor the number of subscribers and may respond to comments and queries on YouTube, but NCI does not collect, maintain, disclose, or share any information about people who follow NCI on YouTube.</p>",
