			"answer": "A biomarker is a biological molecule found in blood, tissue, or other bodily fluids. It can be used to indicate a disease, or as a way to see if the body is responding to treatment.",
			"question": "What is a biomarker, exactly?"
		},
		"1": {
			"answer": "A biomarker test only analyzes the genes in your cancer. It’s different from genetic testing like commercially available ancestry tests or cancer risk testing which look at the genes you inherited from your parents.",
			"question": "Is a biomarker test the same as a genetic test?"
		},
		"2": {
			"answer": "<p>You, your doctor, and the research coordinator will get your biomarker report.</p><p>A version of your biomarker report without any personal information will also be included in the Biobank so approved researchers can see the results.</p><p>The Biobank won’t share your biomarker test results with your insurance companies or your employer. <a href='/participation/privacy' data-route>Learn more about how we protect your privacy.</a></p>",
			"question": "Who can see the results of my biomarker test?"
		},
		"3": {
			"answer": "No, there’s no cost to you for the biomarker test.",
			"question": "Will I have to pay to get the test?"

			"answer": "<p>If you have a cancer in a solid tissue, then the Molecular Characterization Laboratory (MoCha) at the <a href='https://frederick.cancer.gov/' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'>Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research</a> will do the biomarker test on your tissue sample.</p>",
			"question": "Who will do the biomarker test?"
		},
		"5": {
			"answer": "The results of your biomarker test may help your doctor find more individualized treatments for your care, such as a targeted therapy that will work for your kind of cancer. The results may also include information that shows you might qualify for another research study or a clinical trial. It’s possible that the biomarker test won’t change your treatment plan at all if it shows that your current treatment is the best one for you.",
			"question": "Can results of my biomarker test change my treatment plan?"
		},
		"6": {
			"answer": "The biomarker report lists genes that are known to be related to cancer in some way. It also lists changes (variants) in those genes found in the tumor. Doctors may find this information useful when recommending treatment. There are still some changes in cancer genes that are not understood yet. They may be included in the report if they were detected, since they have been found in many cancers. This is another reason why research on these biomarkers is important.",
			"question": "What genes will be included in my biomarker report?"
